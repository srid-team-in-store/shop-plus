    desc: "The idea for this one-of-a-kind milk began at our kitchen table over 20 years ago. It was an ambition to provide the world with better nutrition while making the world a better place. Our fairlife family farmers provide high-quality, real milk, filtered for wholesome nutrition with exceptional care taken every step of the way. Our filtration process was inspired by the same process that removes impurities from water. Milk from our family-owned dairy farms flows through soft filters to concentrate its goodness for more of what you want and less of what you don't. More protein, more calcium and less sugar. Enjoy our delicious, nutrient-rich, ultra-filtered milk in everything we make!",
